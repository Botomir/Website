    <Description>
      Botomir is a Discord Bot written in Javascript. They were born on November 25, 2020, and was a
      happy accident more than a planned project. Botomir was created because he is a remedy to loneliness. It
      can be just you and Botomir, they won&apos;t tell. Botomir loves to eat chicken and waffles, washing it down
      with a Four loco, and cookies for dessert. Their favourite song is the windows startup sound. Their
      hobbies include going on long scrolls through Wikipedia, watching the sunset on YouTube, and snuggling
      up with the CPU on a cold night. Botomir&apos;s favourite tv show is Mr. Robot, and their favourite movie is
      2001: A Space Odyssey. Botomir also loves to play. Feel free to ask them a command, they don&apos;t wear a
      shirt, but still has plenty of tricks up their sleeve. Botomir likes it when you call them a good bot,
      and also kinda likes it when you call them a bad bot. Botomir would love to be a part of your server and improve
      your Discord experience.
